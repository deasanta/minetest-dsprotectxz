 - there are no crafts for this mod to keep it simple and open to modification - use the /giveme dsprotectxz:protectwand command to get started
 - depends on default but easy to change in config area of init.lua so that it does not have to
 - there may be other mods with similar functions that may even work better
 - at the time of writing this mod the engine allowed us check blocks quite far away - this may not always be the case
 - error checking is minimal - can be increased if required
 - interaction feedback in minimal - can be increased if required
 - feel free to rework this mod as you like and but respect copyright of other authors - see readme.txt
 - i'm not a lua expert, advice on how to code these mods better or more efficiently will be appreciated
